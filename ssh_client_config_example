# Example ~/.ssh/config file to connect to an SSH server tunneled by sidedoor.
#
#  - MY_HOSTNAME:   hostname argument to match on the command-line, e.g.,
#                   if you want to access a server by running `ssh pi`,
#                   the hostname would be pi
#  - TUNNEL_PORT:   tunneled port on the "bastion" to connect to, e.g.,
#                   if you passed `-R 8022:localhost:22` to sidedoor,
#                   the tunnel port would be 8022
#  - REMOTE_SERVER: SSH "bastion" to proxy through

Host MY_HOSTNAME
    User sidedoor

    # Tunnel the SSH port through the "bastion" to your client,
    # with end-to-end SSH encryption.
    ProxyCommand ssh -W localhost:TUNNEL_PORT REMOTE_SERVER

    # Optionally, specify a different private key.
