# Example ~/.ssh/config file to connect to an SSH server tunneled by sidedoor.
#
# Replace these placeholders below:
#  - MY_HOSTNAME:   hostname argument to match on the command-line, e.g.,
#                   if you want to access a server by running `ssh pi`,
#                   the hostname would be pi
#  - TUNNEL_PORT:   tunneled port on the "bastion" to connect to, e.g.,
#                   if you passed `-R 8022:localhost:22` to sidedoor,
#                   the tunnel port would be 8022
#  - REMOTE_SERVER: SSH reverse proxy that sidedoor maintains a tunnel to

Host MY_HOSTNAME
    # Access the SSH server through the SSH reverse proxy,
    # with end-to-end SSH encryption. ProxyJump requires OpenSSH 9.3+.
    HostName localhost
    Port TUNNEL_PORT
    ProxyJump REMOTE_SERVER

    # For OpenSSH <9.3, comment out HostName, Port, ProxyJump above
    # and instead use ProxyCommand. Functionally similar.
    #ProxyCommand ssh -W localhost:TUNNEL_PORT REMOTE_SERVER

    # For OpenSSH <5.4, comment out HostName, Port, ProxyJump above
    # and instead use ProxyCommand with netcat. Functionally similar.
    ssh REMOTE_SERVER exec nc localhost TUNNEL_PORT

    # If authorized_keys is populated, log in as the sidedoor user.
    User sidedoor

    # Optionally, specify a different private key.
    #IdentityFile
